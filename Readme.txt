This is a simple Wrapper for the Guild Wars 2 guildwarstrade.com API written using Java JDK 1.7. Feel free to use or modify it. This version is the newest until a new version of the API is released.

Calling getItemInformation() returns a String with the results or throws a GWTradeException if the item could not be found.
